_Fake talk. Fake issues. Real giggles._

Generating content for Wet Toast Talk Radio, a 24/7 non-stop internet parody radio inspired by GTA. 

We don’t do reruns - all shows are generated daily. We use ChatGPT + a lot of prompt engineering and randomization for the writing of the scripts, and the amazing transformer + diffusion models of [tortoise-tts](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts) for speech generation.
